## About

**Ecoi** is a powerful and flexible package designed to simplify economy management tasks. Whether you're building a Discord economy bot or creating a more complex economy management system, Ecoi is equipped to handle all aspects of it with ease. The package was started by [WuiiiGithub](https://github.com/WuiiiGithub)

### History

The Ecoi project started as a simple attempt to build a Discord economy bot. After releasing versions 1 and 2, the complexity of the project grew. As a student developer, I frequently reworked and refined the project to improve its functionality and make it more user-friendly. Eventually, the project evolved into a Python package aimed at simplifying economic management tasks for users.

### Vision

The vision for Ecoi is to develop a comprehensive package that integrates various economy management functions, allowing users to manage their virtual economy in a highly customizable and accessible way. It is designed to be adaptable and extensible for various use cases, making it suitable for everything from small projects to larger-scale systems.

### Status

The project is currently in the early stages of development, focusing on creating a strong foundation for the Python package. The goal is to continuously improve its features and functionality, making it a go-to solution for managing virtual economies.
