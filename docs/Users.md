# Users 
Let `userX`, `another_userY` be created users. Where `X`, `Y` are numbers respectively. Here, the operations that could be performed by users are grouped as follows:

```python
# related packages
from ecoi.core.users import User
from ecoi.core.groups import Group
from ecoi.core.terminals import terminal
```

### **Receive Requests**

When receiving requests, you need to handle various scenarios and edge cases, like filtering requests based on their status, sender, priority, etc. Here’s an expanded view of receiving and managing requests.

```python
# Reading inbox requests
user1.requests.readInbox(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter requests by status, sender, category, etc.
    query_vars: list = None,  # List of query variables to filter (e.g., ['status', 'priority'])
    limit: int = 10,  # Limit number of requests in the inbox
    include_attachments: bool = False,  # Whether to include attachments
    sort_by: str = 'date',  # Sort requests by 'date', 'priority', etc.
    order: str = 'desc',  # Sorting order ('asc', 'desc')
)

# Reading a specific request from inbox
req = user1.requests.getInbox(
    req_id: str,  # Request ID to read
    include_attachments: bool = False,  # Whether to include attachments
    check_status: bool = True,  # Check the status before retrieving
)

# Accepting a request
req.accept(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to accept
    confirm_message: str = "Accepted",  # Confirmation message (optional)
    accept_time: datetime = None,  # Time of acceptance (optional)
)

# Denying a request
req.deny(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to deny
    deny_reason: str = "Not interested",  # Optional reason for denial
)

# Responding to a request (can include a detailed response)
req.respond(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to respond to
    response_message: str,  # Detailed response message
    response_time: datetime = None,  # Timestamp of the response
)

# Ignoring a request (mark as ignored, no further action needed)
req.ignore(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to ignore
)

# Blocking a sender (no future requests from this sender)
req.block(
    sender_id: str,  # Block sender by user ID
)

# Unblocking a sender
req.unblock(
    sender_id: str,  # Unblock sender by user ID
)

# Deleting a request from inbox
req.delete(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to delete
    soft_delete: bool = False,  # Whether to perform soft delete
    permanently: bool = False,  # Permanent deletion
)

# Clearing all requests (bulk delete or clear inbox)
user1.requests.clearAll(
    status: str = 'unread',  # Clear all requests with a certain status (e.g., 'read', 'unread', etc.)
    category: str = None,  # Clear requests from a specific category (optional)
    priority: str = None,  # Clear requests of a specific priority level (optional)
)

# Approving or rejecting multiple requests at once
user1.requests.batchProcess(
    request_ids: list,  # List of request IDs to approve/reject
    action: str = 'approve',  # Action to perform ('approve', 'reject')
    custom_message: str = None,  # Custom message for batch processing (optional)
)

# Read request receipt confirmation (if enabled)
req.readReceipt(
    request_id: str,  # Request ID to read receipt for
    status: str = 'read',  # Status of the request ('read', 'unread')
)
```

### Connection

Managing connections can involve various actions, including making new connections, checking connection statuses, and even managing blocked or unblocked connections. Here's a more detailed approach:

```python
# Connecting with another user
user1.connect(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to connect with
    connection_type: str = 'general',  # Type of connection (e.g., 'friend', 'professional', 'collaborator')
    message: str = None,  # Optional message to send with the connection request
    status: str = 'pending',  # Initial status of the connection ('pending', 'accepted', 'blocked')
    connection_strength: int = 0,  # Strength of the connection (0 = neutral, 10 = strong)
    connection_date: datetime = None,  # Date when the connection was made
    tags: list = None,  # Optional list of tags (e.g., ['important', 'business'])
    shared_interests: list = None,  # List of shared interests (optional)
    source: str = None,  # Where the connection request originated from (e.g., 'networking event', 'social media')
)

# Viewing all connections
user1.connections.viewAll(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter criteria (e.g., 'status': 'accepted', 'type': 'friend')
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query variables for detailed filtering (e.g., ['connection_type', 'status'])
    limit: int = 10,  # Limit the number of connections displayed
    include_muted: bool = False,  # Whether to include muted connections in the view
    sort_by: str = 'connection_date',  # Sorting by connection date, name, or strength
    order: str = 'asc',  # Sorting order ('asc', 'desc')
)

# Checking the connection status
connection_status = user1.connections.checkStatus(
    user2_id: str,  # The ID of the user to check the connection status with
    include_muted: bool = False,  # Include muted connections
)

# Accepting a connection
user1.connections.accept(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to accept
    message: str = 'Accepted your connection request',  # Optional acceptance message
    accepted_at: datetime = None,  # Date and time when the connection was accepted
)

# Rejecting a connection
user1.connections.reject(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to reject
    message: str = 'Rejected your connection request',  # Optional rejection message
    rejected_at: datetime = None,  # Date and time when the connection was rejected
)

# Disconnecting a connection
user1.connections.disconnect(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to disconnect from
    disconnect_reason: str = 'No longer in contact',  # Optional reason for disconnecting
    disconnected_at: datetime = None,  # Date and time when the disconnection occurred
)

# Blocking a connection
user1.connections.block(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to block
    block_reason: str = 'Spam or inappropriate behavior',  # Reason for blocking (optional)
    block_time: datetime = None,  # Date and time when the block occurred
)

# Unblocking a connection
user1.connections.unblock(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to unblock
    unblock_reason: str = 'Mistake or changed circumstances',  # Optional reason for unblocking
    unblock_time: datetime = None,  # Date and time when the unblock occurred
)

# Muting a connection (temporarily ignore their activity)
user1.connections.mute(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the person to mute
    mute_duration: int = 7,  # Duration of mute in days (optional)
    mute_reason: str = 'Need a break from notifications',  # Optional mute reason
)

# Viewing muted connections
user1.connections.viewMuted(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter muted connections (e.g., 'reason': 'personal space')
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query parameters for additional filtering (e.g., ['mute_duration'])
    limit: int = 10,  # Limit number of muted connections to show
    sort_by: str = 'mute_duration',  # Sorting by mute duration or other attributes
    order: str = 'desc',  # Sorting order ('asc', 'desc')
)

# Sending a message to a connection
user1.connections.sendMessage(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the connection to send a message to
    message: str,  # The message content
    message_type: str = 'text',  # Type of message ('text', 'image', 'video', etc.)
    attachment: str = None,  # Optional attachment (link or file path)
    sent_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for the message sent
)

# Reporting a connection for misconduct
user1.connections.report(
    user2_id: str,  # User ID of the connection being reported
    reason: str = 'Inappropriate content',  # Reason for the report
    report_time: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for when the report was made
    additional_notes: str = None,  # Optional notes for the report
)

# Searching for connections based on shared interests or attributes
user1.connections.search(
    interests: list = None,  # List of interests to search connections by (e.g., ['AI', 'Data Science'])
    tags: list = None,  # Tags for searching (e.g., ['business', 'technology'])
    location: str = None,  # Search by location (optional)
    mutual_friends: bool = False,  # Filter for mutual friends (optional)
    connection_type: str = 'general',  # Connection type filter (e.g., 'friend', 'work')
    limit: int = 10,  # Limit the number of search results
)
```

```python
# Sending an event invitation
user1.events.sendInvite(
    event_id: str,  # Event ID for the invitation
    recipient_id: str,  # User ID of the recipient
    invitation_message: str = 'You are invited to our upcoming event!',  # Invitation message
    status: str = 'pending', 

 # Initial status of the invitation ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined')
    sent_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for sending the invitation
)

# Accepting an event invitation
user1.events.acceptInvite(
    event_id: str,  # Event ID for the invitation
    user_id: str = user1.user_id,  # User ID accepting the invitation
    accepted_at: datetime = None,  # Date and time of acceptance
)

    filter: dict = None,  # Optional filter (e.g., 'priority': 'high', 'type': 'notification')
    query_vars: list = None,  # Optional query parameters for filtering (e.g., ['alert_type'])
    sort_by: str = 'timestamp',  # Sorting by timestamp (can also sort by priority or urgency level)
    order: str = 'desc',  # Sorting order ('asc', 'desc')
)

# Clear a specific alert by alert_id
user1.allerts.clear(
    alert_id: str,  # The ID of the alert to clear
    reason: str = 'Alert resolved',  # Optional reason for clearing the alert
    cleared_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for when the alert is cleared
)

# Clear all alerts
user1.allerts.clearAll(
    reason: str = 'Bulk clearance',  # Reason for clearing all alerts
    cleared_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for when the alerts are cleared
)

# Deny an alert sender (prevent further alerts from this sender)
user1.allerts.deny(
    sender_id: str,  # User ID or system ID of the sender
    deny_reason: str = 'Spam or irrelevant alerts',  # Reason for denial
    denied_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for when the denial occurs

    level: str  # New level to upgrade to, e.g., 'secure', 'vault'
)
```
---

## Economic Operations

### Wallet

Managing the wallet's monetary operations effectively is crucial in a virtual economy, and it should support various parameters, features, and methods for users to interact with their virtual finances.

```python
# Read the wallet's current balance and transaction history
user1.wallet.read(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter options (e.g., 'status': 'active')
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query parameters (e.g., ['currency', 'transaction_type'])
    limit: int = 10,  # Number of records to fetch (limit transaction history)
    sort_by: str = 'date',  # Sort transactions by date, amount, etc.
    order: str = 'desc',  # Order of results ('asc', 'desc')
)

# Add money to the wallet with optional metadata (e.g., source, transaction ID)
user1.wallet.addMoney(
    amount: float,  # Amount of money to add
    transaction_id: str = None,  # Optional transaction ID for tracking
    source: str = 'transfer',  # Source of money (e.g., 'transfer', 'earnings', 'deposit')
    reason: str = None,  # Reason for adding money (e.g., 'job payment')
    currency: str = 'USD',  # Currency type (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', 'BTC')
    timestamp: datetime = None,  # Optional timestamp for when the money is added
)

# Get the current balance and available funds
user1.wallet.getMoney(
    currency: str = 'USD',  # Optional currency type to retrieve balance in specific currency
    include_locked: bool = False,  # Include locked (pending or frozen) funds in the balance
)

# Remove money from the wallet with optional reason and conditions
user1.wallet.removeMoney(
    amount: float,  # Amount of money to remove
    reason: str = 'payment',  # Reason for removing money (e.g., 'payment', 'purchase', 'withdrawal')
    currency: str = 'USD',  # Currency type to use for removal
    fee: float = 0.0,  # Optional transaction fee if applicable
    lock: bool = False,  # Lock the money for the operation (for secure transactions)
    timeout: int = 30,  # Timeout for the operation in seconds (e.g., for time-sensitive operations)
)

# Clear the wallet (use with caution; may be a full reset)
user1.wallet.clear(
    confirmation: bool = False,  # Confirm before clearing
    reason: str = 'user request',  # Reason for clearing the wallet (e.g., 'user request', 'error fix')
    cleared_at: datetime = None,  # Timestamp for when the wallet is cleared
)

# Upgrade wallet capabilities (e.g., increase limit, add premium features)
user1.wallet.upgrade(
    upgrade_type: str = 'premium',  # Type of upgrade (e.g., 'premium', 'business')
    duration: int = 30,  # Duration of the upgrade in days
    new_limits: dict = {'transaction_limit': 5000},  # New transaction or withdrawal limits
    additional_features: list = ['instant_transfer', 'high_security'],  # Additional features
    timestamp: datetime = None,  # Timestamp of the upgrade
)
```

### Safe

A virtual safe is used for securing funds and assets, and its operations can be more restrictive, with additional features such as withdrawal limits and security settings.

```python
# Read the safe's current balance and transaction history

### Banks

Bank accounts allow for more sophisticated operations, such as borrowing, lending, and loan closures. Banks can be customized with various parameters to simulate a realistic banking experience.

```python
# Read all banks associated with the user
user1.banks.read(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter by attributes (e.g., 'status': 'active')
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query variables (e.g., ['bank_name', 'location'])
    limit: int = 5,  # Limit the number of banks returned
)

# Get a specific bank and create a new account in that bank
user1Bank = user1.banks.getBank(bank_id)
acc_id = user1Bank.createAccount(
    bank_id: str,  # Bank ID where the account is being created
    name: str,  # Account holder's name
    initial_amount: float = 1000,  # Initial deposit amount
    account_type: str = 'checking',  # Account type ('savings', 'checking')
    currency: str = 'USD',  # Currency for the account (e.g., 'USD', 'BTC')
    interest_rate: float = 0.03,  # Optional interest rate for savings accounts
    overdraft_protection: bool = False,  # Whether overdraft protection is enabled
)

# Get a list of accounts in the bank
user1Bank.getAccounts(bank_id).read(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filter for accounts (e.g., 'active': True)
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query parameters (e.g., 'account_type', 'status')
    limit: int = 5,  # Limit results (optional)
)

# Get a specific account and perform operations
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).read()  # Get account details
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).addMoney(1000)  # Deposit money into account
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).getMoney()  # Get current balance
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).removeMoney(1000)  # Withdraw money

# Borrow money from the bank with conditions
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).borrowReq(
    amount: float,  # Amount to borrow
    collateral: dict = None,  # Collateral (e.g., {'property': 'house', 'value': 50000})
    loan_type: str = 'personal',  # Type of loan ('personal', 'mortgage', 'auto')
    interest_rate: float = 0.05,  # Interest rate
    repayment_period: int = 12,  # Loan repayment period in months
    approval_status: str = 'pending',  # Loan approval status ('pending', 'approved', 'denied')
)

# Process a loan borrowing request
lend_id = user1.requests.read(
    filter: {
        "status": "pending",
        "fromType": "bank",
        "details": {"bank_id": bank_id, "account_id

": acc_id, "type": "borrow"},
    },
    query_vars: ["lend_id"],
)["lend_id"]

# Approve the loan and finalize borrowing
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).borrow(
    amount: float,  # Amount of loan
    lend_id: str,  # Lending ID
)

# Close the loan and pay it off
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).borrowClosure(
    lend_id: str,  # Lending ID to close
    amount_paid: float,  # Amount paid to close loan
)

# Clear the account (e.g., delete or reset account)
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).clear()

# Upgrade account features (e.g., interest rates, fees)
user1Bank.getAccount(acc_id).upgrade(
    upgrade_type: str = 'premium',  # Type of upgrade (e.g., 'premium', 'business')
    features: list = ['higher_interest', 'no_fee'],  # Additional features
    duration: int = 30,  # Duration of the upgrade
)

# Delete the account
user1Bank.delAccounts(acc_id)

# Delete the bank
user1.banks.delBank(bank_id)
```

### **Status**
Users can maintain their statuses for various reasons, such as updates, alerts, or even tracking.

```python
# Read status updates
user1.status.read(
    filter: dict = None,  # Filters for status (e.g., 'active': True)
    query_vars: list = None,  # Query parameters for specific statuses
    limit: int = 5,  # Limit number of statuses returned
)

# Add a new status update
user1.status.addStatus(
    link: str,  # URL or reference link
    description: str = None,  # Additional details or description for the status
    visibility: str = 'public',  # Visibility options ('public', 'private', 'friends')
    timestamp: datetime = None,  # Timestamp of the status update
)

# Remove a status update
user1.status.removeStatus(
    status_id: str,  # ID of the status to remove
)
```
